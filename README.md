# URLJoin in Pure Types

A pure TypeScript type-based implementation of the [url-join](https://www.npmjs.com/package/url-join) library.

## Features

- Entirely crafed with TypeScript types.
- Incorporates all test cases from the original [`url-join@5.0.0`](https://github.com/jfromaniello/url-join/blob/main/test/tests.js) library, ensuring compatibility and reliability.
- Additional tests for edge cases have been added to verify that the output aligns with that of `url-join` itself.

## Usage

Simply copy the code from `src/index.ts` into your own project.
